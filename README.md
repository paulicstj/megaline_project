Statistical analyis, hypothesis testing.  
You work as an analyst for the telecommunications operator Megaline. The company offers its customers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The sales department wants to know which plan generates the most revenue so they can adjust their advertising budget.

You will conduct a preliminary analysis of plans based on a relatively small customer selection. You will have data on 500 Megaline customers: who they are, where they are from, what plan they use, as well as the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze customer behavior and determine which prepaid plan generates the most revenue.
